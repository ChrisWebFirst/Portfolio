                        <em>18 years ago</em> I married an amazing woman Aimee. Together we have two children (Ethan & Levi).
                        Family is a big deal to me. A typical week for us means work and trying to get time with our boys.  One is 13 and the other is 10.  It seems like time just gets away from us.
                        Being a father and a husband are the most challenging and rewarding things of my life.  When we have time, we love spending it with other close family friends.
