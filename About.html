                            <em>18 years ago</em> I married an amazing woman Aimee. Together we have two children (Ethan & Levi).
                            Family is a big deal to me. A typical week for us means work and trying to get time with our boys.  One is 13 and the other is 10.  It seems like time just gets away from us.
                            Being a father and a husband are the most challenging and rewarding things of my life.  When we have time we love spending it with a few family on trips.

                            I work as a software developer based out of <a href="https://monroela.us" target="_blank">Monroe, LA</a>.  I started programming about 5 years ago.  At the time, I was a supervisor over a distribution center that was moving into lean manufacturing.  I couldn't find the right software for our company so I wrote a program.
                            It was an asp.net project with server side C# and Html on the client side.  During this project, I fell in love with programming.  My company hired me as a full time programmer and have since written numerous programs and web applications.
                            I have developed a pretty wide range of programming knowledge and skills.  The strongest of which includes the following:

                            <li>Javascript/ JQuery</li>
