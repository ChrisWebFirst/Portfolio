                            Flower General is a wholesale flower provider. They receive flowers from numerous countries and distribute them to retailers all across the United States.
                            I have had the privilege of building two websites for them over the years. You can visit them <br><a href="https://flowergeneral.com" target="_blank">here</a>.

                            I've had the opportunity to build numerous projects for Allied Building Stores.  The Build-A-Door program is a really cool tool to be able to build
                            exterior doors for your house.  It is fairly user friendly and requires very little knowledge of doors.  Maybe a just little style...  This tool allows a customer to pick a store, then build a quote.
                            This quote can then be sent to the store.  The stores manage their orders and quotes before sending them to <abbr title="Allied Building Stores">ABS</abbr> to be built.  You can try it out

                            I have spent most of my time at <abbr title="Allied Building Stores">ABS</abbr> with this application.  It has roughly 670 Html pages in the application.  We do every thing from receiving freight in the distribution center to paying the bank
                            through this application.  Our members can do all interactions with our company through this website.  If you are not a member there are a few pages you can see.  They can be viewed
