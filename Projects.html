                  <p>I've had the opportunity to build numerous projects for Allied Building Stores.  The Build-A-Door program is a really cool tool to be able to build
                      exterior doors for your house.  It is fairly user friendly and requires very little knowledge of doors.  Maybe a just little style...  This tool allows a customer to pick a store, then build a quote.
                      This quote can then be sent to the store.  The stores manage their orders and quotes before sending them to <abbr title="Allied Building Stores">ABS</abbr> to be built.  You can try it out
